\section{Introduction}
At one point or another everyone who drives has encountered this scenario; you plan to go to a mall for the day so you drive all the way there only to discover that the parking lot is seemingly full. You must frustratingly drive around the parking area to try and find a single spot, if you even find one. This problem has existed for as long as vehicles have, and while some rudimentary and limited solutions exist such as a parking structure noting how many open spots exist when you enter, there are no solutions that an average consumer can use to solve the problem preemptively. Imagine if there was a way that you could know exactly how many spots were open in a parking lot at a given time and where they were, before you even left your house. \\

On the other hand, imagine being a business owner and having the ability to see trends in how many visitors arrived on a given day, how long the average visitor stayed, or even if a vehicle has been parked in a paid spot for longer than they should. ParkMe is a mobile application and parking availability system that aims to provide valuable information not only to customers, but also businesses.


\subsection{Behaviour Overview}
To solve the problems mentioned above, ParkMe will implement several general systems. The first and most important of these is the ability to monitor the occupancy of parking spots in a given parking area through a series of physical sensors. This data will then be used by the mobile application to update the customer on the number of available spots in the lot, as well as the location of those spots. Specific data on information such as accessible parking, expectant mothers, paid parking...etc will also be displayed, and will utilize preferences set by the user. \\

Ideally, the application will also include functionality to navigate the user to a parking spot/row/area, but this integration will depend on the accuracy and availability of GPS systems and the complexity of those systems. In addition, a secondary section of the application which will only be available to verified business owners will include various statistics and trends based on the data gathered by the system, allowing those owners to better tailor their experience to the customers, and increasing returns as well.



\subsection{Scope}
ParkMe will allow customer users to receive up-to-date information on the availability of parking spots in a desired lot. They will be able to know where their desired parking spot is, and may also be able to get navigation to the spot. Additionally, they will be able to mark where they parked.  The business users will be able to access a separate interface where they can view information and statistics that can be made from the parking data. These may include things such as average occupancy rates for parking spots, overall number of visits and departures based on time/day...etc.

\subsubsection{Stakeholders}
There are two main stakeholders who will be interested in our product, the consumers, and businesses. The consumers are the everyday people who use the application for parking availability. The businesses can constitute two groups, but are handled in the same way. One of these groups is the small business, who owns a smaller lot and is interested in customer information and trends. The second group is the large business. This group is composed of entities such as the owner of an entire mall, rather than the individual businesses inside of the mall who wouldn't be able to glean any useful information from the parking trends. Making sure that both of these groups find our system useful is imperative for its success.\\

The consumer will find use in knowing that parking spots are open for a store they wish to visit, and will have less frustration physically finding a spot. This is good for both the consumer and the business, as it will ensure that not being able to find a parking spot will not deter a potential customer.The business will find use in being able to recognize trends in their customer attendance, allowing them to make changes which improve their own potential goals as well as improving the experience for the customer. In this way, ParkMe satisfies both major stakeholders and the relationship between them is strengthened as well.

\section{Monitored and Controlled Variables}
ParkMe only contains two systems where it interacts with the environment around it: The mobile application where the user interacts with our system directly and the system responds back. The parking identifier is the second system where the users only interact with it and it does not directly interact with it.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Security Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item SR1: Communication between the android application and the server should be done through a secure connection.

        \end{table}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Cultural and Political Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item CPR1: The product will not include any messages or images that will offend parties of any culture or religion.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The application is targeted to users age 16+ (or driving age). Users should not see any offensive messages or images. If ads are present, they should be curated first to enforce this.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item CPR2: The product will comply with current Canadian cultural standards.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Legal Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item LR1: All assets used are either original works. It will not infringe on any copyrights and appropriate permission/licensing will be acquired.
	\item LR2: The product will comply with Canadian copyright laws.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Health and Safety Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
	\item HSR1: Our application interface will pose no threat to epileptic prone users.
	
	\item HSR2: The system will provide hands-free features that will allow the user to use some functionality of the application without using their hands such as speech-to text input and text-to-speech navigation output.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item As the user is operating a motor vehicle, the system must not distract the driver to adhere to driving laws.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Undesired Event Handling}
In the event of a undesired event that is not a result of a previously stated assumption, the system will be designed in such a way that it will self-correct any discrepancies. This means that any synchronization issues between the application and the servers will be fixed by the use of multiple users supplying data to the database. Additionally, this issue will be further solved by updating periodically so that the most recent data is used. Finally, in the case of an undesired event that is not covered, the use of error handling and error messages will be implemented to prevent any confusion for the user and any disastrous errors within the system. 

\section{Requirements Likely to Change}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \hyperlink{APR8}{APR8}: The system must show if there is a time limit associated with a parking space.
    \begin{itemize}\item The feasibility of this requirement will be determined later in the development process.\end{itemize}
    \item \hyperlink{APR9}{APR9}: The user must be warned if their time limited parking space will expire in
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This requirement is dependent on if \hyperlink{APR8}{APR8} still holds.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \hyperlink{APR12}{APR12}: The system must show the distance to the closest building entrance from the userâ€™s selected parking space.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The feasibility of this requirement will be determined later in the development process.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Requirements Unlikely to Change}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \hyperlink{APR13}{APR13}: The application will warn the user to be cautious during the hours of 8pm and 8am and/or when parking lots are less than 10 percent occupied. (The purpose of this is to remind users to be safe at night where parking lots/garages can be unsafe.)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item While simple to implement it is an additional non-critical feature that may extend development time. [Changed from LC to UC, from Rev0 to Rev1, as we believe there is enough time to implement.]
