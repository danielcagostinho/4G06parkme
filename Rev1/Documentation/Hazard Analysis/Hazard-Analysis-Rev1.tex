\section{Introduction}
Although ParkMe has very little physical interaction with the environment and the users, like most products, there is still inherent risk that comes with the system. The assumption is that the user will be driving for most of the interaction of the system. The system needs to ensure that it does not pose a risk to the driver, nor cause the driver to be distracted and further cause damage with their vehicle.


\subsection{Scope}
The victims of these hazards are not limited to just the driver and others in cars. Damage may also occur to pedestrians, other stationary vehicles, the physical sensors for the system, and infrastructure of the parking lot. All of these potential victims must be accounted for in analyzing the hazards of the system. Although the system cannot directly harm the user, there are control actions that the system makes that can have consequences that will lead to an accident or a loss. The correctness of the system’s sensing and output of the sensor data/ geographical location is imperative for the safe use of the system. Thus the control actions that are within the scope of the hazard analysis are the ones that are directly responsible for receiving and outputting the information to the user.


\subsection{Purpose}
This document serves to outline the hazards associated with the product ParkMe. The hazard analysis technique that will be used for this document is the STPA technique. First we will identify the main control actions that can be hazardous. Then for each control action we will determine the hazards that come with those actions. We will breakdown the system control actions by component as can be seen in Figure 1. Finally the consequences of the hazards will be shown in the consequence matrix in Table 2.
